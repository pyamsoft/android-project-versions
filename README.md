# android-project-versions
Android Project Current Versions

## What is this

This is the endpoint for pyamsoft application version checking.  
Each file in this repository aside from this README and the LICENSE  
is the package name of a pyamsoft Android application. The license checking  
code will query for the CURRENT_VERSION contents of a specific file as the  
current released version of the application. As such, this repository will  
always contain up to date version numbers for the most recently released  
stable version of a pyamsoft Android application.
